# Azul
Once upon a time, I made a very nice MCTS based bot to play Azul. However, that project is private and I am not allowed to share that code outside of the course.
So I built my own vibe-coded Azul page in a single afternoon using chatGPT and Copilot.

## Base
At its base, this project is Azul implemented in Typescript. See the rules for Azul [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Azul).


## GPT
I found GPT to be great at quickly getting the boilerplate up, but it really fell apart after repeated failing to implement the more complex rules of Azul.

That prompted me to switch to Copilot. Being able to include the code files within its context, I was at least able to step-by-step prompt Copilot to gradually build the game, rule-by-rule. Every so often I would still have to manually do some code because Copilot would simply fail to make good code.
